# UFPR-ALPR Dataset

![Teaser image](./media/samples.png)

This dataset, called UFPR-ALPR dataset, includes 4,500 fully annotated images (over 30,000 LP characters) from 150 vehicles in real-world scenarios where both the vehicle and the camera (inside another vehicle) are moving. It has been introduced in our IJCNN paper [[PDF]](./pdfs/paper.pdf).

The images were acquired with three different cameras and are available in the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format with a size of 1,920 × 1,080 pixels. The cameras used were: GoPro Hero4 Silver, Huawei P9 Lite, and iPhone 7 Plus.

We collected 1,500 images with each camera, divided as follows:

* 900 of cars with gray LP;
* 300 of cars with red LP;
* 300 of motorcycles with gray LP.

The dataset is split as follows: 40% for training, 40% for testing and 20% for validation. Every image has the following annotations available in a text file: the camera in which the image was taken, the vehicle’s position and information such as type (car or motorcycle), manufacturer, model and year; the identification and position of the LP, as well as the position of its characters. The full details are in our [paper](./pdfs/paper.pdf).
